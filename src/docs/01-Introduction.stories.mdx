# Welcome

JDS is a React component library, which is being developed primarily as a tool to simplify and speed up my future personal projects. Inspired by Material UI, it aims for convenient API and high degree of intuitive use.

Currently, it is still a work in progress.

The codebase can be found at <a href="https://github.com/jaikeex/jds">Github</a>
